He often visited when he was off-duty ready to listen to the fishermen and helping to resolve their arguments.\\n\\n'The inspector was a real community man,' Bobby Sylliboy, a longtime band constable with the Burnt Church First Nation, said. 'He was a professional. And for him to use force, it would have had to have been life or death.'\\n\\nRelatives added that Vickers' constable son, Andrew, is also a selfless leader after he saved a drowning woman three years ago.\\n\\nAfter Wednesday's fraught events, MPs hailed Kevin Vickers a hero.\\n\\nRiveting video: Vickers led the way as officials chased down terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday after he murdered reservist Nathan Cirillo and entered the House of Commons building\\n\\nInches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms\\n\\nJob done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning\\n\\n'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself.

He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.\\n\\nBoth things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.\\n\\n'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'\\n\\nHe was called into action after Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ran towards the National War Memorial just before 10am on Wednesday and shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a single dad, in the abdomen.\\n\\nHe then ran towards the Parliament and opened fire, shooting dozens of shots as politicians and journalists barricaded doors inside.\\n\\nVideo taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons shows a rush of armed police running toward an unseen suspect.\\n\\nVictim: Nathan Cirillo, 24, was standing guard at the memorial when he was fatally shot in the abdomen\\n\\nRemembered: A Canadian flag flies at half staff on top of the Peace Tower at the Parliament on Thursday\\n\\nPatrol: Members of the Ottawa Police stand guard in front of the War Memorial one day after the attack\\n\\nVigilant: A police officer patrols the hallway near the entrance to the Parliamentary Library on Thursday\\n\\nChilling: Bullet holes are seen in a window of the rotunda of the House of Commons in Ottawa on Thursday\\n\\nAt the head of the pack is a man - Vickers - moving swiftly with his gun toward Zehaf-Bibeau. Vickers takes aim and fires off multiple shots, killing the gunman.\\n\\nAs shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.\\n\\nIt has since emerged that the gunman - whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau - had recently converted to Islam and had a length history of petty crime.\\n\\nHe had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized, according to reports.\\n\\nOn Thursday, his mother Susan Bibeau, who sits on the country's Immigration board, released a statement saying she had been shocked by the shooting spree and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime.\\n\\nTribute: Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the scene of the shooting on Thursday morning to lay flowers\\n\\nAll quiet: Evidence tags can be seen on the steps of the memorial as the Harpers walk away\\n\\nRemembered: Flowers with a card for Corporal Cirillo can be seen at the foot of the War Memorial\\n\\nShe said she felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of her son.\\n\\n'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press.

Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.\\n\\nCirillo, from Hamilton, Ontario, has been remembered as a generous man and a fitness fanatic, who rescued dogs and was bringing up a kindergarten age son on his own.\\n\\n'He was an amazing guy,' Michelle Howlett, who briefly dated Cirillo this summer, told the Washington Post. 'He was a real sweetheart. He had a son and was a real great father. He was an exceptional person.'\",\n          \"Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the \\u201c18-karat gold\\u201d Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!\\n\\nDo you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, \\u201cThe Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition\\u201c\\n\\nGold is Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don\\u2019t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.\\n\\nUpdate: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit \\u201cback of the envelope.\\u201d Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\\u2026\\n\\nHere are the basic facts:\\n\\nGold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.\\n18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.\\nOne ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.\\n18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.\\n.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!\\n\\nGold Watches are Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it\\u2019s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let\\u2019s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 \\u2013 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.\\n\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200\\nNow let\\u2019s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That\\u2019s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you\\u2019re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.\\n\\nHow does this translate in the real world? Let\\u2019s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.\\n\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street\\nCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street\\nThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street\\nThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it\\u2019s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!\\n\\nCertainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.\\n\\nAnother reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can\\u2019t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker\\u2019s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!\\n\\nApple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That\\u2019s not going to happen. So they\\u2019re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.\\n\\nFirst, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.\\n\\nCould it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, \\u201csolid\\u201d in their press releases, they do claim it is \\u201ccrafted from 18-karat gold\\u201d and nowhere does it say it is plated or \\u201cgold filled\\u201d (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.\\n\\nApple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it\\u2019s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.\\n\\nGold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as \\u201cstandard gold\\u201d. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.\\n\\nMy prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it\\u2019s possible with some finagling and if that\\u2019s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.\\n\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.\\n\\nUpdate!\\n\\nNeedless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I\\u2019ll hear from lots of them real soon!\\n\\nThe gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there\\u2019s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.\\n\\n\\nI think this number is way too low, but it\\u2019s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he\\u2019s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.\\n\\nAnother argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it\\u2019s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it\\u2019s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we\\u2019re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.\\n\\nSo there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let\\u2019s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we\\u2019re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, \\u201cIf anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.\\u201d\\n\\nRegardless of the total, it\\u2019s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver\\u2019s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.\\n\\nI\\u2019d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

Of course.\\n\\nThe quality: Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real, if unbelievable, subject on March 3, 2015: As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week, a DEA agent testified that he came across \\u201crabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana\\u201d while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country.

He was an exceptional person.'\",\n          \"Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the \\u201c18-karat gold\\u201d Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!\\n\\nDo you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, \\u201cThe Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition\\u201c\\n\\nGold is Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don\\u2019t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.\\n\\nUpdate: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit \\u201cback of the envelope.\\u201d Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\\u2026\\n\\nHere are the basic facts:\\n\\nGold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.\\n18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.\\nOne ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.\\n18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.\\n.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!\\n\\nGold Watches are Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it\\u2019s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let\\u2019s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 \\u2013 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.\\n\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200\\nNow let\\u2019s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That\\u2019s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you\\u2019re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.\\n\\nHow does this translate in the real world? Let\\u2019s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.\\n\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street\\nCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street\\nThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street\\nThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it\\u2019s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!\\n\\nCertainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.\\n\\nAnother reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can\\u2019t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker\\u2019s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!\\n\\nApple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That\\u2019s not going to happen. So they\\u2019re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.\\n\\nFirst, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.\\n\\nCould it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, \\u201csolid\\u201d in their press releases, they do claim it is \\u201ccrafted from 18-karat gold\\u201d and nowhere does it say it is plated or \\u201cgold filled\\u201d (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.\\n\\nApple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it\\u2019s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.\\n\\nGold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as \\u201cstandard gold\\u201d. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.\\n\\nMy prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it\\u2019s possible with some finagling and if that\\u2019s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.\\n\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.\\n\\nUpdate!\\n\\nNeedless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I\\u2019ll hear from lots of them real soon!\\n\\nThe gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there\\u2019s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.\\n\\n\\nI think this number is way too low, but it\\u2019s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he\\u2019s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.\\n\\nAnother argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it\\u2019s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it\\u2019s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we\\u2019re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.\\n\\nSo there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let\\u2019s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we\\u2019re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, \\u201cIf anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.\\u201d\\n\\nRegardless of the total, it\\u2019s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver\\u2019s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.\\n\\nI\\u2019d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

Of course.\\n\\nThe quality: Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real, if unbelievable, subject on March 3, 2015: As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week, a DEA agent testified that he came across \\u201crabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana\\u201d while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country. It\\u2019s hard to believe, a drug enforcement agent\\u2019s encounter with stoned rabbits, but that part\\u2019s real. The fake part: The Onion quoted fake people\\u2019s reactions to the all-too-real news. \\u201cRabbits are going to be getting high anyway,\\u201d one hilariously fake person said. \\u201cBetter that it be safe, legal, and regulated.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crappy: Fake news site The Daily Currant wrote a story under the headline \\u201cMarijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization\\u201d on Jan. 2, 2014. It began ridiculously: \\u201cColorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses.\\u201d How anyone could believe such a story, from such an outlet, is still dumbfounding.\\n\\nAnd now some more fake news is on the loose \\u2014 and it falls on the crappy, lowest-common-denominator side. The Racket Report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece, \\u201cKFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.\\u201d\\n\\nNevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment \\u2014 what about the scrolling \\u201cNews Ticker\\u201d above the headline pitching other \\u201cnews\\u201d including \\u201cExclusive Photos Of Miley Cyrus And Justin Bieber\\u2019s Wedding!\\u201d and \\u201c69 People Die After Drinking Bad Coors Lite At A Funeral.\\u201d Neither of those headlines threw off the 200,000-plus people sharing this story to their own social media?\\n\\nThe Racket Report\\u2019s piece said KFC \\u201cdecided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants. Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee. The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License. Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this \\u2018option\\u2019 to their menu.\\u201d\\n\\nSounds believable, right?\\n\\nWrong.

'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.\\n\\nShe apparently took everyone for a boob.\\n\\nA 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.\\n\\nBut an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is not a fake,\\\" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. \\\"I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.\\\"\\n\\nThe publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.\\n\\nThe massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.\\n\\n\\\"I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,\\\" she told the Sun. \\\"I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.\\\"\\n\\nSince Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite \\\"Total Recall.\\\"\\n\\nShe did give a Tampa TV station \\\"a quick flash,\\\" but wouldn't show more because \\\"I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.\\\"\\n\\nShe may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I am crazy,\\\" she told the \\\"The News Junkie\\\" show. \\\"Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.\\\"\\n\\nPolice said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.\\n\\nTridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.\\n\\n\\\"She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'\\\" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. \\\"I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'\\\"\\n\\nAnd in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: \\\"I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag\\\" after he allegedly groped and beat her.\\n\\nShe also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.\\n\\ndboroff@nydailynews.com\",\n          \"New details are surfacing about what happened when Joan Rivers was having surgery and a source has revealed to CNN that her doctor took a selfie inside the operating room while she was under anesthesia.\\n\\nThe 81-year-old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, but after the clinic\\u2019s medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure, an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords.\\n\\nInvestigators think that Joan\\u2018s vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy, which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the \\u201c18-karat gold\\u201d Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!\\n\\nDo you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, \\u201cThe Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition\\u201c\\n\\nGold is Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don\\u2019t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.\\n\\nUpdate: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit \\u201cback of the envelope.\\u201d Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\\u2026\\n\\nHere are the basic facts:\\n\\nGold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.\\n18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.\\nOne ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.\\n18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.\\n.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!\\n\\nGold Watches are Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it\\u2019s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let\\u2019s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 \\u2013 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.\\n\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200\\nNow let\\u2019s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That\\u2019s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you\\u2019re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.\\n\\nHow does this translate in the real world? Let\\u2019s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.\\n\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street\\nCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street\\nThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street\\nThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it\\u2019s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!\\n\\nCertainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.\\n\\nAnother reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can\\u2019t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker\\u2019s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!\\n\\nApple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That\\u2019s not going to happen. So they\\u2019re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.\\n\\nFirst, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.\\n\\nCould it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, \\u201csolid\\u201d in their press releases, they do claim it is \\u201ccrafted from 18-karat gold\\u201d and nowhere does it say it is plated or \\u201cgold filled\\u201d (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.\\n\\nApple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it\\u2019s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.\\n\\nGold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as \\u201cstandard gold\\u201d. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.\\n\\nMy prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it\\u2019s possible with some finagling and if that\\u2019s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.\\n\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.\\n\\nUpdate!\\n\\nNeedless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I\\u2019ll hear from lots of them real soon!\\n\\nThe gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there\\u2019s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.\\n\\n\\nI think this number is way too low, but it\\u2019s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he\\u2019s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.\\n\\nAnother argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it\\u2019s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it\\u2019s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we\\u2019re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.\\n\\nSo there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let\\u2019s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we\\u2019re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, \\u201cIf anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.\\u201d\\n\\nRegardless of the total, it\\u2019s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver\\u2019s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.\\n\\nI\\u2019d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee. The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License. Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this \\u2018option\\u2019 to their menu.\\u201d\\n\\nSounds believable, right?\\n\\nWrong. As I wrote a year ago as the \\u201cMarijuana Overdoses Kill 37\\u2033 story was going viral:\\n\\nWe\\u2019re all too discerning to believe everything we read online. But you read this and didn\\u2019t check (the site\\u2019s) About page or proven, local-to-Colorado news sources before Facebooking it. Next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity, you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact.\\n\\nThe Racket Report\\u2019s About page says \\u201csome stories on this website are fictitious.\\u201d Gee, really?\\n\\nThe beauty of the weed-at-KFC ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a KFC selling marijuana in California \\u2014 though it\\u2019s a Kind For Cures medical dispensary and not a Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant, as Inquisitr reported.\\n\\nThe shop\\u2019s website even notes, \\u201cThis ain\\u2019t no chicken joint!\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"agree\",\n          \"discuss\",\n          \"unrelated\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If people don't believe it, that's up to them.\\\"\\n\\nThe publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.\\n\\nThe massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.\\n\\n\\\"I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,\\\" she told the Sun. \\\"I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.\\\"\\n\\nSince Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite \\\"Total Recall.\\\"\\n\\nShe did give a Tampa TV station \\\"a quick flash,\\\" but wouldn't show more because \\\"I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.\\\"\\n\\nShe may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I am crazy,\\\" she told the \\\"The News Junkie\\\" show. \\\"Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.\\\"\\n\\nPolice said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.\\n\\nTridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.\\n\\n\\\"She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'\\\" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. \\\"I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'\\\"\\n\\nAnd in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: \\\"I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag\\\" after he allegedly groped and beat her.\\n\\nShe also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.\\n\\ndboroff@nydailynews.com\",\n          \"New details are surfacing about what happened when Joan Rivers was having surgery and a source has revealed to CNN that her doctor took a selfie inside the operating room while she was under anesthesia.\\n\\nThe 81-year-old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, but after the clinic\\u2019s medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure, an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords.\\n\\nInvestigators think that Joan\\u2018s vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy, which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the \\u201c18-karat gold\\u201d Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!\\n\\nDo you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, \\u201cThe Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition\\u201c\\n\\nGold is Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don\\u2019t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.\\n\\nUpdate: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit \\u201cback of the envelope.\\u201d Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\\u2026\\n\\nHere are the basic facts:\\n\\nGold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.\\n18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.\\nOne ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.\\n18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.\\n.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!\\n\\nGold Watches are Expensive\\n\\nLet\\u2019s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it\\u2019s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let\\u2019s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 \\u2013 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.\\n\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300\\nA simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200\\nNow let\\u2019s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That\\u2019s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you\\u2019re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.\\n\\nHow does this translate in the real world? Let\\u2019s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.\\n\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThis Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold\\nThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street\\nCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street\\nThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street\\nJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street\\nThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it\\u2019s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!\\n\\nCertainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.\\n\\nAnother reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can\\u2019t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker\\u2019s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!\\n\\nApple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That\\u2019s not going to happen. So they\\u2019re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.\\n\\nFirst, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.\\n\\nCould it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, \\u201csolid\\u201d in their press releases, they do claim it is \\u201ccrafted from 18-karat gold\\u201d and nowhere does it say it is plated or \\u201cgold filled\\u201d (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.\\n\\nApple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it\\u2019s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.\\n\\nGold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as \\u201cstandard gold\\u201d. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.\\n\\nMy prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it\\u2019s possible with some finagling and if that\\u2019s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.\\n\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nThis is a $10,000 product\\nBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.\\n\\nUpdate!\\n\\nNeedless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I\\u2019ll hear from lots of them real soon!\\n\\nThe gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there\\u2019s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.\\n\\n\\nI think this number is way too low, but it\\u2019s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he\\u2019s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.\\n\\nAnother argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it\\u2019s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it\\u2019s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we\\u2019re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.\\n\\nSo there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let\\u2019s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we\\u2019re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, \\u201cIf anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.\\u201d\\n\\nRegardless of the total, it\\u2019s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver\\u2019s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.\\n\\nI\\u2019d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

you think according to 9to5mac the highly anticipated wearable could arrive in the united states by the end of march the company is planning on familiarizing its apple store employees with the wearable product through training programs held in cupertino california and austin texas in sessions scheduled for feb 9 through feb 16 the employees who attend this conference will then train employees at their local stores apple declined to comment to cnbc tuesday evening since its introduction in september the apple watch has gone through extensive testing in particular apple is refining the product s battery and charging mechanism according to the report there are three tiers slated for the apple watch standard sport and edition thus far the company has revealed that the glass and metal sport model will cost consumers 349 however rumors indicated that the stainless steel and sapphire crystal watch will likely be priced at 500 and the gold device will be sold for more than 1 000 read the full report from 9to5mac\",\n          \"get ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announces the retail price for the gold apple watch edition model apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers but the 18 karat gold apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of 10 000 the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that much do you disagree check out my counterpoint the case against the 10 000 gold apple watch edition gold is expensive let s start with a little backgrounder in gold everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive even rabid internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news but most people don t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is so this is a good place to begin the discussion update my calculations were wrong also this was a bit back of the envelope now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic here are the basic facts gold currently sells for between 1 200 and 1 300 per troy ounce and has been over 1 000 per troy ounce for the last five years 18 karat gold contains 75 pure gold and that term is regulated by law one ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1 8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18 karat gold alloy weighs about 16 5 grams per cc 18 karat gold currently sells for 29 11 per gram 905 per troy ounce or 480 per cc 25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and 75 cc gets you a deployant clasp it takes a few more to build a watch case anywhere from 1 5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle is worth 120 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6 000 gold watches are expensive let s apply this to a watch case imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep if it was solid this would equal 15 12 cc of volume but it s a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so let s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around making a hollow rectangle this equals 6 8 cc 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3 200 as of this writing a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would cost over 8 300 a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would cost more than 3 200 now let s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick that s 2 9 cc of gold worth 1 400 pick your thickness and you re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold how does this translate in the real world let s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18 karat gold this cartier tank mc is 15 000 more in 18k gold this cartier tank mc is 15 000 more in 18k gold the cartier tank mc measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9 5 mm thick 15 000 extra list for 18k gold cartier tank mc in stainless steel 7 000 list 5 800 street cartier tank mc in 18k pink gold 22 000 list 18 200 street the jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime measures 50 5 mm by 34 9 mm by 14 mm thick 14 750 extra list for 18k gold jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in stainless steel 8 550 list 6 800 street jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in 18k pink gold 23 300 list 18 400 street this list could go on and on but the gist is simple 18 karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel in fact it s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10 000 in any size and from any manufacturer even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sells for 11 000 most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14 karat or less very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated pricing then there s the bracelet swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra 20 000 adding a gold bracelet to that jaeger lecoultre bumps the price to 42 900 certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case and the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities there are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold and plenty of reserves so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility they can t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long so they generally price somewhat higher than they would even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials labor distribution and profit in a watch the apple watch edition will cost 10 000 there s a reason i picked those two watches for my comparisons both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm apple watch the cartier is a little smaller and the jaeger lecoultre is a little larger but both represent a traditional watchmaker s gold cased square ish offering in the space and both cost more than 20 000 with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle and jony ive recently said that the historic cartier tank was one of his inspirations for the apple watch design apple would be crazy to sell the apple watch edition for 20 000 though that s not going to happen so they re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically first as we can see the apple watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot second apple watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensors and such third the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions could it be gold plated no numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case although apple has not apparently used the word solid in their press releases they do claim it is crafted from 18 karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled the industry term there are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and apple cannot break these any more than tiffany could apple says that the apple watch will start at 349 for that aluminum sport model and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly 1 000 it is reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggesting 4 000 or 5 000 but remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold even with thin walls and a steel frame it s hard to see how apple could make a solid 18 karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold gold is soft but apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold taking that at face value perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch this still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case the apple watch edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume so the smaller model could sell for 20 less still my prediction is that the 42 mm apple watch edition will retail for 9 999 with the 38 mm apple watch edition retailing for 7 999 this covers the cost of the gold case the internals manufacturing sales and profit and yet does not leave apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too thin or plated case i will be shocked if the price is 4 999 but i suppose it s possible with some finagling and if that s the smaller model and it will not be any less than that this is a 10 000 product this is a 10 000 product bonus prediction given the very high price of the apple watch edition i predict that availability will be quite limited apple will likely create special store within a store spaces in certain apple store locations for the edition i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutiques to sell the watch edition accessories and perhaps other future high end products update needless to say many people disagree with me and now that gruber fireballed this post i imagine i ll hear from lots of them real soon the gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case i assumed it would be quite thick read sturdy and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold then there s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams but gak_pdx and others though he was most visually eloquent suspects it contains much less gold i think this number is way too low but it s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow and it puts the raw gold at about 849 at 29 11 per gram of 18k gold although this is admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrates my point that the apple watch edition is not going to be cheap and i think he s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold rolex watch right off the bat one should point out that gold cost 400 oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well something apple is apparently not going to do with the edition that rolex case contained 18 5 grams of gold alloy but it s much much smaller than the apple watch and it s circular to boot a 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference while the 42mm apple watch is 156mm in circumference use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we re at 27 75 grams but that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel and the apple watch is pretty slab sided so we can probably double this safely and come out with 1 615 of gold in my mangled square rolex case so there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold i can accept that but let s take a step back and think about the final price even if it contained less than 1 500 of gold how much would it sell for certainly not 2 000 or 3 000 you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution and profit for apple and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold so we re back at the 4 000 5 000 estimate others have made as greg koenig tweeted and forbes reported if anyone thinks apple is charging less than 5k for the edition they are smoking crack regardless of the total it s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver s seat when it comes to pricing the apple watch edition i d love to be wrong and i look forward to updating this piece thanks for

When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.\\n\\nTridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.\\n\\n\\\"She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'\\\" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. \\\"I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'\\\"\\n\\nAnd in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: \\\"I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag\\\" after he allegedly groped and beat her.\\n\\nShe also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.\\n\\ndboroff@nydailynews.com\",\n          \"New details are surfacing about what happened when Joan Rivers was having surgery and a source has revealed to CNN that her doctor took a selfie inside the operating room while she was under anesthesia.\\n\\nThe 81-year-old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, but after the clinic\\u2019s medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure, an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords.\\n\\nInvestigators think that Joan\\u2018s vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy, which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs.

steven for over a year and we miss him very much she said in a video message to the isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi we want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him sotloff 31 wrote about conflict in the middle east for time magazine and other publications he grew up in miami and attended the university of central florida in the early 2000s he has a twitter account and last posted aug 3 2013 just before he disappeared isis threatened sotloff s life in another video last month in that video isis beheaded another american journalist james foley and said that it would kill sotloff too

the defence staff general sir nicholas houghton warned however that the isis leadership would regenerate even if baghdadi had been killed general houghton told the bbc i can t absolutely confirm that baghdadi has died even the americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation friday s strikes destroyed an isis convoy near the iraqi city of mosul but us officials said it was unclear whether the group s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles tribal sources told the saudi news channel al arabiya that after the strike isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured meanwhile iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of baiji on sunday trying to break the isis siege of the country s biggest refinery outside the city this led to fierce fighting sunni insurgents had seized baiji in june during a lightning advance through northern iraq since then they surrounded the refinery and halted its production while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege an iraqi colonel said troops had entered baiji a city of about 200 000 people from the south and west and took over the al tamim neighbourhood and city centre isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the

depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an american journalist has raised concerns in the uk about the background of the isis jihadist the washington post s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have americans thinking twice too in an interview with the bbc foreign secretary philip hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a british accent and said the video seemed to be genuine hundreds of britons are believed to have traveled to syria to fight in the country s civil war including many who have joined the islamic state we re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of british nationals involved in terrible crimes probably in the commission of atrocities hammond said many of these people may seek at some point to return to the u k and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security a european intelligence official said the british government was examining the video and the speech of the purported executioner to compare it with former guantanamo bay prisoners and other british residents believed to have joined the islamic state both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the u s military prison at guantanamo bay cuba a similar outfit believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison was worn by nicholas berg an american businessman kidnapped in iraq in 2004 whose execution by an islamic state precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online the may 2004 berg killing was conducted by abu musab al zarqawi the leader of tawhid wal jihad at the beginning of the 2003 iraq war which became al qaeda in iraq aqi at around the time of that beheading us forces killed zarqawi in an american airstrike but aqi survived his death and the anbar awakening if barely to morph into isis when the us pulled out of iraq berg was not the only american beheaded by zarqawi either he also killed owen eugene armstrong later in the same year and both berg and armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered as did james foley the orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing guantanamo bay but the british seem concerned that there s more than just symbolism now in play with isis the us began releasing british subjects from gitmo during the bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight we ve seen plenty of recidivism since then and all to this same end to rejoin the jihad against the west and the nations in this region and to recruit others to do the same it won t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former gitmo detainee but it is a bit of a surprise that the uk doesn t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately after all they have already been identified as threats picked up in the battle zones far from home which is how they ended up in gitmo in the first place the bigger worry for the uk and for the us and other western nations will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous it should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger especially since we re now desperately looking for ways to roll back isis perhaps we shouldn t provide them more fighters than they already have\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

training programs held in cupertino california and austin texas in sessions scheduled for feb 9 through feb 16 the employees who attend this conference will then train employees at their local stores apple declined to comment to cnbc tuesday evening since its introduction in september the apple watch has gone through extensive testing in particular apple is refining the product s battery and charging mechanism according to the report there are three tiers slated for the apple watch standard sport and edition thus far the company has revealed that the glass and metal sport model will cost consumers 349 however rumors indicated that the stainless steel and sapphire crystal watch will likely be priced at 500 and the gold device will be sold for more than 1 000 read the full report from 9to5mac\",\n          \"get ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announces the retail price for the gold apple watch edition model apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers but the 18 karat gold apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of 10 000 the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that much do you disagree check out my counterpoint the case against the 10 000 gold apple watch edition gold is expensive let s start with a little backgrounder in gold everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive even rabid internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news but most people don t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is so this is a good place to begin the discussion update my calculations were wrong also this was a bit back of the envelope now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic here are the basic facts gold currently sells for between 1 200 and 1 300 per troy ounce and has been over 1 000 per troy ounce for the last five years 18 karat gold contains 75 pure gold and that term is regulated by law one ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1 8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18 karat gold alloy weighs about 16 5 grams per cc 18 karat gold currently sells for 29 11 per gram 905 per troy ounce or 480 per cc 25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and 75 cc gets you a deployant clasp it takes a few more to build a watch case anywhere from 1 5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle is worth 120 360 and the watch case 720 to 3800 just as raw gold this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than 6 000 gold watches are expensive let s apply this to a watch case imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep if it was solid this would equal 15 12 cc of volume but it s a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so let s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around making a hollow rectangle this equals 6 8 cc 42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10 therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost 3 200 as of this writing a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would cost over 8 300 a simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18 karat gold would cost more than 3 200 now let s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick that s 2 9 cc of gold worth 1 400 pick your thickness and you re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold how does this translate in the real world let s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18 karat gold this cartier tank mc is 15 000 more in 18k gold this cartier tank mc is 15 000 more in 18k gold the cartier tank mc measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9 5 mm thick 15 000 extra list for 18k gold cartier tank mc in stainless steel 7 000 list 5 800 street cartier tank mc in 18k pink gold 22 000 list 18 200 street the jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime measures 50 5 mm by 34 9 mm by 14 mm thick 14 750 extra list for 18k gold jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in stainless steel 8 550 list 6 800 street jaeger lecoultre reverso squadra hometime in 18k pink gold 23 300 list 18 400 street this list could go on and on but the gist is simple 18 karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel in fact it s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under 10 000 in any size and from any manufacturer even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sells for 11 000 most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14 karat or less very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated pricing then there s the bracelet swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra 20 000 adding a gold bracelet to that jaeger lecoultre bumps the price to 42 900 certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case and the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities there are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold and plenty of reserves so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility they can t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long so they generally price somewhat higher than they would even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials labor distribution and profit in a watch the apple watch edition will cost 10 000 there s a reason i picked those two watches for my comparisons both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm apple watch the cartier is a little smaller and the jaeger lecoultre is a little larger but both represent a traditional watchmaker s gold cased square ish offering in the space and both cost more than 20 000 with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle and jony ive recently said that the historic cartier tank was one of his inspirations for the apple watch design apple would be crazy to sell the apple watch edition for 20 000 though that s not going to happen so they re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically first as we can see the apple watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot second apple watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensors and such third the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions could it be gold plated no numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case although apple has not apparently used the word solid in their press releases they do claim it is crafted from 18 karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled the industry term there are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and apple cannot break these any more than tiffany could apple says that the apple watch will start at 349 for that aluminum sport model and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly 1 000 it is reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggesting 4 000 or 5 000 but remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold even with thin walls and a steel frame it s hard to see how apple could make a solid 18 karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold gold is soft but apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold taking that at face value perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch this still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case the apple watch edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes a difference of about 20 in terms of case volume so the smaller model could sell for 20 less still my prediction is that the 42 mm apple watch edition will retail for 9 999 with the 38 mm apple watch edition retailing for 7 999 this covers the cost of the gold case the internals manufacturing sales and profit and yet does not leave apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too thin or plated case i will be shocked if the price is 4 999 but i suppose it s possible with some finagling and if that s the smaller model and it will not be any less than that this is a 10 000 product this is a 10 000 product bonus prediction given the very high price of the apple watch edition i predict that availability will be quite limited apple will likely create special store within a store spaces in certain apple store locations for the edition i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutiques to sell the watch edition accessories and perhaps other future high end products update needless to say many people disagree with me and now that gruber fireballed this post i imagine i ll hear from lots of them real soon the gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case i assumed it would be quite thick read sturdy and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold then there s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams but gak_pdx and others though he was most visually eloquent suspects it contains much less gold i think this number is way too low but it s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow and it puts the raw gold at about 849 at 29 11 per gram of 18k gold although this is admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrates my point that the apple watch edition is not going to be cheap and i think he s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold rolex watch right off the bat one should point out that gold cost 400 oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well something apple is apparently not going to do with the edition that rolex case contained 18 5 grams of gold alloy but it s much much smaller than the apple watch and it s circular to boot a 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference while the 42mm apple watch is 156mm in circumference use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we re at 27 75 grams but that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel and the apple watch is pretty slab sided so we can probably double this safely and come out with 1 615 of gold in my mangled square rolex case so there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold i can accept that but let s take a step back and think about the final price even if it contained less than 1 500 of gold how much would it sell for certainly not 2 000 or 3 000 you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution and profit for apple and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold so we re back at the 4 000 5 000 estimate others have made as greg koenig tweeted and forbes reported if anyone thinks apple is charging less than 5k for the edition they are smoking crack regardless of the total it s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver s seat when it comes to pricing the apple watch edition i d love to be wrong and i look forward to updating this piece thanks for reading\",\n          \"in 2015 there s the quality fake news and the crappy fake news examples of course the quality fake news source the onion quoted fake people on a very real if unbelievable subject on march 3 2015 as the utah senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week a dea agent testified that he came across rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back country it s hard to believe a drug enforcement agent s encounter with stoned rabbits but that part s real the fake part the onion quoted fake people s reactions to the all too real news rabbits are going to be getting high anyway one hilariously fake person said better that it be safe legal and regulated the crappy fake news site the daily currant wrote a story under the headline marijuana overdoses kill 37 in colorado on first day of legalization on jan 2 2014 it began ridiculously colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses how anyone could believe such a story from such an outlet is still dumbfounding and now some more fake news is on the loose and it falls on the crappy lowest common denominator side the racket report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece kfc gets occupational business license to sell marijuana in colorado restaurants nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment what about the scrolling news ticker above the headline pitching other news including exclusive photos of miley cyrus and justin bieber s wedding and 69 people die after drinking bad coors lite at a funeral neither of those headlines threw off the 200 000 plus people sharing this story to their own social media the racket report s piece said kfc decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their colorado franchise restaurants franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional 35 000 setup fee the kfc corporation was approved on february 3 2015 for their marijuana retail recreational pot medical marijuana occupational business license currently 42 of the nearly 100 kfc franchises in the state of colorado have added this option to their menu sounds believable right wrong as i wrote a year ago as the marijuana overdoses kill 37 story was going viral we re all too discerning to believe everything we read online but you read this and didn t check the site s about page or proven local to colorado news sources before facebooking it next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact the racket report s about page says some stories on this website are fictitious gee really the beauty of the weed at kfc ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a kfc selling marijuana in california though it s a kind for cures medical dispensary and not a kentucky fried chicken fast food restaurant as inquisitr reported the shop s website even notes this ain t no chicken joint\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

abducted a year ago in syria in a video made public tuesday by a jihadist monitoring organization the monitoring organization site intel group announced on twitter that sotloff had been beheaded it said that isis had also threatened to execute a british captive david cawthorne haines last week sotloff s mother shirley pleaded directly with the leader of isis to spare her son we have not seen steven for over a year and we miss him very much she said in a video message to the isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi we want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him sotloff 31 wrote about conflict in the middle east for time magazine and other publications he grew up in miami and attended the university of central florida in the early 2000s he has a twitter account and last posted aug 3 2013 just before he disappeared isis threatened sotloff s life in another video last month in that video isis beheaded another american journalist james foley and said that it would kill sotloff too unless the united states ended airstrikes against the militant group the white house press secretary josh earnest said that he could not confirm the authenticity of the sotloff video he said that the united states had devoted significant time and resources to rescuing sotloff the cia also said that it could not confirm authenticity\",\n          \"iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of baiji in attempt to break the isis siege of the country s biggest refinery authorities in iraq were tonight investigating claims that the isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi had been critically injured in us led air strikes prompting speculation of his death the death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the us led effort to curtail the islamist extremist group britain s chief of the defence staff general sir nicholas houghton warned however that the isis leadership would regenerate even if baghdadi had been killed general houghton told the bbc i can t absolutely confirm that baghdadi has died even the americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation friday s strikes destroyed an isis convoy near the iraqi city of mosul but us officials said it was unclear whether the group s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles tribal sources told the saudi news channel al arabiya that after the strike isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured meanwhile iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of baiji on sunday trying to break the isis siege of the country s biggest refinery outside the city this led to fierce fighting sunni insurgents had seized baiji in june during a lightning advance through northern iraq since then they surrounded the refinery and halted its production while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege an iraqi colonel said troops had entered baiji a city of about 200 000 people from the south and west and took over the al tamim neighbourhood and city centre isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing tactics used in other cities held by the ultra hardline sunni group which controls swathes of both iraq and syria\",\n          \"the british accent in the video that depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an american journalist has raised concerns in the uk about the background of the isis jihadist the washington post s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have americans thinking twice too in an interview with the bbc foreign secretary philip hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a british accent and said the video seemed to be genuine hundreds of britons are believed to have traveled to syria to fight in the country s civil war including many who have joined the islamic state we re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of british nationals involved in terrible crimes probably in the commission of atrocities hammond said many of these people may seek at some point to return to the u k and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security a european intelligence official said the british government was examining the video and the speech of the purported executioner to compare it with former guantanamo bay prisoners and other british residents believed to have joined the islamic state both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the u s military prison at guantanamo bay cuba a similar outfit believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison was worn by nicholas berg an american businessman kidnapped in iraq in 2004 whose execution by an islamic state precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online the may 2004 berg killing was conducted by abu musab al zarqawi the leader of tawhid wal jihad at the beginning of the 2003 iraq war which became al qaeda in iraq aqi at around the time of that beheading us forces killed zarqawi in an american airstrike but aqi survived his death and the anbar awakening if barely to morph into isis when the us pulled out of iraq berg was not the only american beheaded by zarqawi either he also killed owen eugene armstrong later in the same year and both berg and armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered as did james foley the orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing guantanamo bay but the british seem concerned that there s more than just symbolism now in play with isis the us began releasing british subjects from gitmo during the bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight we ve seen plenty of recidivism since then and all to this same end to rejoin the jihad against the west and the nations in this region and to recruit others to do the same it won t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former gitmo detainee but it is a bit of a surprise that the uk doesn t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately after all they have already been identified as threats picked up in the battle zones far from home which is how they ended up in gitmo in the first place the bigger worry for the uk and for the us and other western nations will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous it should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger especially since we re now desperately looking for ways to roll back isis perhaps we shouldn t provide them more fighters than they already have\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
